# Introduction

Welcome! DirectX Guide is an [open source](https://github.com/realandrew/directx_guide) website that attempts to teach the DirectX (more specifically Direct3D) graphics API (using the Rust language) and related real-time graphics topics.

This site is currently a placeholder. I plan to start working on in the next few years, but currently my effort is being put into my [Vulkan Guide](https://vulkanguide.com/).
